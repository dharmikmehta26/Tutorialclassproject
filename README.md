Tutrorial class predictive model app to predict new entries by users


This is Data Science process to build and deploy a Machine Learning Model that can predict a Admission status of student, by following the steps below :

1.Setting the research goal
2.Retrieving Data
3.Data Preprocessing & Cleansing
4.Data Exploration & Visualization
5.Data Modeling
6.Model Deployment

Most of data science beginners know about creating a best accurate model but doesnt know how to deploy the model in real time production.
so here i have tried doing the deployment of app with help of heroku platform.I am still in a learning phase so many of app styling codes have refered from google project.

For deployment :-

Kindly refer this link for deployment guide
